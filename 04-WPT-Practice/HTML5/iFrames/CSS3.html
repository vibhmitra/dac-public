        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's a programming language
        for styling web pages. CSS is used to describe how HTML or XML elements
        should be rendered on screen, on paper, or in other media. It allows for
        the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors,
        and fonts. This separation makes it possible to present the same markup
        page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
        on-screen, in print, by voice, and on Braille-based tactile devices
