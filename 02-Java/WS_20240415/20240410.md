String[] lis - return s names of all files and subdir present in 


FileWriter 
	- we can write char data 
	FileWriter o = new FileWriter(<path-to-file>, boolean append);
				or
	FileWriter o = new FileWriter(<File object>, boolean append);
	If file isn't available; this will make a new file

	flush and clean

	We have to set line seperator manyally which varries from system to system

FileReader
	- to read char data
	- int read() -- return integer value, so we need to cast it to see it properly
	- NOT RECOMMENDED | again the line seperator problem
	- it runs line by line.

BufferedWriter
	- never communicates with file directly; it comm with File Object
	- BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("file.txt"))
	- Double buffereing is also possible
	- if we close Buffered
	- Read data line-by-line
	meth:

PrintWriter Class
	- directly comm w/ file
	- write(100)	-- will put char 
	- print(100)	-- will put 100
	- InputStreams / OutputStreams - to write binary data
